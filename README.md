# Advent of Code 2025

See [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025/) for details.

It reminds me of the
[Lego advent calendar](https://www.lego.com/en-us/holiday-gifts/advent-calendars)
where each model is a tiny investment in time to build it.  I look at Advent of
Code as a similar low-investment opportunity to practice some coding on puzzles
that can be interesting without having tons of gotchas.

### Why Ruby?

I'm doing them in **Ruby** because while I'm not an expert, I know it well
enough and I could use some more practice.

I'm more knowledgeable in **Java**, but it takes more work to get anything done
in Java.  I feel my knowledge of **Python** is not quite strong enough; I would
spend even more time looking things in the language.  I could have tried
**JavaScript**, but I feel Ruby is a little better at parsing text than JS.

I could have tried **Groovy**, but it's been a while since I've coded in Groovy
and it has been losing popularity lately.  I feel that's unfortunate.

### Why Are There No Tests?!?

I just tinker on these late in the evening.  For these, I care more about coming
up with a solution that I find elegant than adhering to strict engineering
discipline.  I try to keep the code "simple", so each solution is a single
script that operates on an input text file and writes to stdout.
