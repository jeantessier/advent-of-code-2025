## Puzzle 1

I have no clue.

I wrote code to parse the input, but I'm drawing a blank on how to solve it.  I
feel like I need to try each permutation of shapes, and for each shape, try each
orientation and flip (up to 8 variations).  Some geometries cut down on these
variations.  For example, an `H` shape is the same when flipped and when rotated
180&deg;, so it has only two variations.
